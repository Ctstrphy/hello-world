Test git
This is Ctstrphy testing github. I'm a newbie at using git.
I've been a hobby programmer since 2009. I atleast have the minimum knowledge requirement to read and write in C.
I've been practicing how to code in C++ and Python. This is the beginning of a new journey. I hope I'd learn more things.
